# HypothesisWorld research plan

## Primary question

Can explicit hypothesis competition and active falsification improve completion and
human-relative action efficiency in unseen ARC-AGI-3 environments over novelty-only and
non-hypothesis world-model baselines?

## Testable claims

1. Prediction disagreement produces more diagnostic early actions than novelty alone.
2. Explicit contradiction tracking avoids repeating disproven action-effect rules.
3. Compact object-level outcomes transfer across visually distinct states better than
   exact frame transitions.
4. Switching from experiments to short-horizon planning after confidence rises improves
   action efficiency without catastrophically reducing exploration.
5. Salience-conditioned coordinate actions dominate uniformly sampled coordinates.

## Measurement

Primary outcomes are levels completed and official Relative Human Action Efficiency.
Secondary outcomes are actions to first progress, deaths, unique compact states,
hypotheses falsified, calibration of predicted outcomes, prediction entropy, and the
fraction of actions chosen primarily for information versus progress.

Compare all six ablations with fixed seeds and identical game/version/action budgets.
Report per-game results rather than only an aggregate, and keep public-game tuning
separate from held-out conclusions. Re-run any stochastic baseline across multiple seeds.

## What is research and what is scaffolding?

Research mechanisms:

- simultaneous falsifiable outcome hypotheses with explicit contradiction records;
- prediction-disagreement as an actionable approximation to information gain;
- confidence-dependent arbitration between experimentation and planning;
- object/context-conditioned proposals for coordinate experiments;
- rejected-hypothesis memory with evidence-based reconsideration.

Engineering scaffolding:

- connected-component perception and greedy object matching;
- bounded counters, hashes, event logs, configuration flags, and notebook packaging;
- an empirical transition table and depth-two graph planner;
- official framework lifecycle handling and synthetic regression tests.

The scaffolding is intentionally replaceable. A useful experiment should change one
research mechanism while leaving the official evaluation path and measurements stable.

## Known failure modes to watch

- A dominant colour is not always semantic background; camouflage or large objects can
  be mis-segmented.
- Same-colour touching objects merge under connected-component perception.
- Animation timing may make a transient effect look like a stable causal outcome.
- Exact state fingerprints fragment experience when counters or cosmetic pixels change.
- Greedy matching is ambiguous among repeated identical objects.
- Outcome hypotheses describe correlations and may confuse preconditions with effects.
- Sparse reward and irreversible actions can make active experiments too expensive under
  the squared action-efficiency metric.
- The depth-two planner cannot compose unseen transformations or infer distant goals.

## Next five experiments

1. Replace exact frame hashes with learned stable masks and object-relation state keys;
   measure transition reuse and false state aliasing.
2. Add relational hypothesis templates (`touching`, `inside`, `aligned`, `same colour`)
   and compare causal prediction calibration against outcome-only hypotheses.
3. Estimate expected information gain by posterior rollouts rather than entropy of point
   predictions; compare diagnostic actions per unit of RHAE cost.
4. Learn reversible action models and use `ACTION7` or safe reset-aware counterfactual
   experiments where the framework exposes them.
5. Validate the scene-change prediction/observation contract before adding latent-state
   hypotheses. The [September 18 action-history pilot](experiments/reports/2026-09-18-action-history.md)
   improved public fallback prediction error by only 0.18% and added no completed
   levels; the implementation was rejected. A progress-only synthetic fixture also
   exposed inconsistent change definitions. Evaluate future history models on
   held-out games with preregistered thresholds and seeds.
